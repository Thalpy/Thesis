\chapter{Appendix}

%appendix
For each measurement site, a minimum of 100 force curve readings per site was taken, with the raw data saved in a single file. The full dataset is attached as a zip file for each concentration, site and parameters. Run folders correspond to approach curves, Run-ret are retract folders.

Because there are an incredible amount of images involved the dataset, the entire appendix has been provided as a comprehensive .7z file. If this 7z is missing, it's because it was too big to upload.
