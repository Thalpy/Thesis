	abstract = {Understanding and controlling the surface adhesion of pathogenic bacteria is of urgent biomedical importance. However, many aspects of this process remain unclear (for example, microscopic details of the initial adhesion and possible variations between individual cells). Using a new high-throughput method, we identify and follow many single cells within a clonal population of Escherichia coli near a glass surface. We find strong phenotypic heterogeneities: A fraction of the cells remain in the free (planktonic) state, whereas others adhere with an adhesion strength that itself exhibits phenotypic heterogeneity. We explain our observations using a patchy colloid model; cells bind with localized, adhesive patches, and the strength of adhesion is determined by the number of patches: Nonadherers have no patches, weak adherers bind with a single patch only, and strong adherers bind via a single or multiple patches. We discuss possible implications of our results for controlling bacterial adhesion in biomedical and other applications.},

abstract  ="Bacterial adhesion is a crucial step during the development of infections as well as the formation of biofilms. Hence{,} fundamental research of bacterial adhesion mechanisms is of utmost importance. So far{,} less is known about the size of the contact area between bacterial cells and a surface. This gap will be filled by this study using a single-cell force spectroscopy-based method to investigate the contact area between a single bacterial cell of Staphylococcus aureus and a solid substrate. The technique relies on the strong influence of the hydrophobic interaction on bacterial adhesion: by incrementally crossing a very sharp hydrophobic/hydrophilic interface while performing force-distance curves with a single bacterial probe{,} the bacterial contact area can be determined. Assuming circular contact areas{,} their radii - determined in our experiments - are in the range from tens of nanometers to a few hundred nanometers. The contact area can be slightly enlarged by a larger load force{,} yet does not resemble a Hertzian contact{,} rather{,} the enlargement is a property of the individual bacterial cell. Additionally{,} Staphylococcus carnosus has been probed{,} which is less adherent than S. aureus{,} yet both bacteria exhibit a similar contact area size. This corroborates the notion that the adhesive strength of bacteria is not a matter of contact area{,} but rather a matter of which and how many molecules of the bacterial species{'} cell wall form the contact. Moreover{,} our method of determining the contact area can be applied to other microorganisms and the results might also be useful for studies using nanoparticles covered with soft{,} macromolecular coatings."}

abstract = "An atomic force microscope (AFM) has been used to quantify directly the adhesive interactions between a silica sphere and a planar silica surface. Electrostatic double-layer interactions have also been quantified through analysis of approach curves. The surfaces of the sphere and planar surface were treated prior to measurements either by ethanol washing or by plasma treatment. Adhesion forces were then measured in 0.01 M NaCl solutions at pH 3 and 8. The adhesion force did not vary greatly with pH for a given cleaning procedure. However, the magnitudes of the adhesion forces were substantially less for the plasma treated surfaces. The adhesion forces did not vary systematically with the loading force. Agreement of the adhesion measurements with theory (DLVO, using a non-retarded Hamaker constant based on the latest interpretation of spectroscopic data for water) was good for the ethanol treated surface at pH 3 — conditions where double layer interactions are negligible. However, the plasma treated surface at pH 3 showed adhesion an order of magnitude lower than calculated. In contrast, adhesion at pH 8 was in both cases greater than theoretical expectations, though the lower adhesion for the plasma treated surface was in quantitative agreement with the increased electrostatic double–layer interactions induced by plasma treatment. The results show that the adhesion of such surfaces is a complex phenomenon and that non-DLVO interactions probably play a substantial overall role."

abstract  ="A unique{,} but unifying{,} feature of ionic liquids (ILs) is that they are nanostructured on the length scale of the ions; in many ILs well-defined polar and apolar domains exist and may percolate through the liquid. Near a surface the isotropic symmetry of the bulk structure is broken{,} resulting in different nanostructures which{,} until now{,} have only been studied indirectly. In this paper{,} in situ amplitude modulated atomic force microscopy (AM-AFM) has been used to resolve the 3-dimensional nanostructure of five protic ILs at and near the surface of mica. The surface and near surface structures are distinct and remarkably well-defined{,} but are very different from previously accepted descriptions. Interfacial nanostructure is strongly influenced by the registry between cations and the mica surface charge sites{,} whereas near surface nanostructure is sensitive to both cation and anion structure. Together these ILs reveal how interfacial nanostructure can be tuned through ion structure{,} informing {"}bottom-up{"} design and optimisation of ILs for diverse technologies including heterogeneous catalysis{,} lubrication{,} electrochemical processes{,} and nanofluids."}

abstract={We present a procedure to perform and interpret pull-off force measurements during the jump-off-contact process between a liquid drop and rough surfaces using a conventional atomic force microscope. In this method, a micrometric liquid mercury drop is attached to an AFM tipless cantilever to measure the force required to pull this drop off a rough surface. We test the method with two surfaces: a square array of nanometer-sized peaks commonly used for the determination of AFM tip sharpness and a multi-scaled rough diamond surface containing sub-micrometer protrusions. Measurements are carried out in a nitrogen atmosphere to avoid water capillary interactions. We obtain information about the average force of adhesion between a single peak or protrusion and the liquid drop. This procedure could provide useful microscopic information to improve our understanding of wetting phenomena on rough surfaces.},
