There is a certain critical value of the surface charge density (or the total surface charge) separating two distinct cases: low surface charge density case and high surface charge density case. In the latter case counterion condensation occurs in the vicinity of the particle surface. The results are in excellent agreement with numerical calculations for the case of dilute suspensions.}

abstract = "The simplicity, consistency and an understanding of the limitation of the original DLVO theory has been lost. Where the theory apparently fails, new words to describe `non-DLVO' forces have been invented. `Extra-DLVO' forces, words like hydration, structural, oscillatory, hydrophobic, depletion, fluctuation, protrusion forces infest the literature. Some are real enough but some have the status of phlogiston. All predictability has disappeared in a confused proliferation of parameters. The original theory does not account for specific ion effects embraced by the term Hofmeister series. Nor did it pretend to. There is a fundamental inconsistency even at the continuum level in treating double layers via a non linear theory, and van der Waals-Casimir-Lifschitz forces by a linear theory. Further no theories have considered the effects of dissolved gas which are extremely important. An account will be given of the present situation in colloidal interactions, and how to resolve it."

Hydrophobic regions or metal oxide impurities were masked with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) or phosphate, respectively. Deposition rates exhibited a remarkable ionic strength sensitivity in the presence of 10-3M SDS that was similar to unfavorable filtration predictions using DI,VO theory. The strong influence of SDS on particle deposition rates indirectly suggests that particle attachment is enhanced by uncharged, hydrophobic regions of the latex or quartz. Phosphate had little effect on either electrophoretic mobilities or particle deposition rates."

abstract = "Understanding the interaction forces that can act between particles and surfaces continues to be the focus of an extensive amount of research. While direct measurements of the force between molecularly smooth surfaces generally show good agreement with traditional models, experiments performed with more natural particles and surfaces frequently show substantial discrepancies. One well-known example is the deposition rate of particles flowing through a packed bed; numerous experimental studies have found significant deposition occurring when essentially none was predicted. Many researchers have suggested that the cause of such discrepancies is heterogeneities on the interacting surfaces, either in the form of surface roughness or a non-uniform surface charge density. Although accounting for such factors requires some simplifying assumptions about the nature of the heterogeneity (e.g. that the roughness is in the form of hemispherical asperities), the models which have been developed have indeed provided much better agreement with measured results. This article is a review of some of the work that has been performed to understand the effect of surface roughness and a non-uniform surface charge density on colloidal forces. Long range, short range and particle adhesion forces are included and the relative advantages and limitations of the computational approaches are discussed where appropriate. It is shown that although various modeling strategies have been used, the predicted trends are generally in qualitative agreement. Also presented are applications of these models to the prediction of particle flocculation and deposition rates."

abstract="An experimental technique has been developed to study the deposition of colloidal particles under well controlled hydrodynamic conditions. The deposition process is observed under a microscope and recorded on video tape for further analysis. Fluid flow conditions in the experimental set-up were determined by numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. Mass transfer equations were solved numerically (taking into account hydrodynamic, gravitational, electric double layer, and dispersion forces) for the stagnation point region. Also, some analytical solutions are presented. Deposition has been studied of 0.5$\mu$m polystyrene latex particles on cover glass slides used as collectors. From an analysis of the shape of the coating density vs. time curves and independently from the distribution of the particles on collector surfaces, it was found that one particle is able to block an area of about 20 to 30 times its geometrical cross-section. The initial flux of particles to the collector for a given salt concentration was found to depend strongly on the method of cleaning the collector surface. In general the flux and the escape of particles to and from the collector surface are sensitive to the interaction energy at small separations. The direct method of observing particle deposition and detachment could lead to important insights into the nature of particle-wall interactions at near contact.",

abstract  ="The interaction{,} across aqueous electrolyte{,} of two charged plates is studied. The charges on each plate take up a discrete periodic lattice structure. Our treatment is based on a Debye–Hückel procedure and use of Fourier–Bloch functions similar to those used in solid state physics. The interaction energy depends on the relative configuration of the charge lattices on the particles. For like charges{,} the energy is always positive giving a repulsive force. The minimum energy is obtained when the charge lattices interlace each other and leads to a primary maximum in the total interaction energy which is depressed considerably below the smeared out result. The maximum energy is sufficiently large that one would expect particles never to approach with superposed charge lattices.For oppositely charged plates{,} the minimum energy is for superposed charged lattices and is considerably more negative than the smeared out result. The former tends to –∞ as → 0; the latter tends to a finite value. For interlaced equal and opposite charged lattices{,} we obtain a new result namely that the interaction energy may becomes positive at small separations giving a repulsive force."}

abstract = "The adsorption of nanometer-sized silica particles on a macroscopic silica surface pretreated with different polymers was studied using optical reflectometry in a stagnation point flow cell. Efficient sticking of particles occurs only when no electrostatic repulsion between particles and surface exists. Cationic polyelectrolytes, e.g., partially methylated poly(vinylimidazole), are very efficient in inducing adsorption of negatively charged SiO2particles. Competition between the negatively charged SiO2particles and an anionic polymer present in the suspension reduces the amount of particles adsorbed on the surface. Adsorbed nanometer-sized silica particles do not become embedded in the adsorbed polymer layer but rather stay on the periphery of this layer on the time scale of the experiment (15 min). Therefore, repeated sequential addition of adsorbing polymer and particles will lead to controllable high amounts of particles on the surface."

This chapter employs a first principles approach to unravel the effects of interfaces in solid-state pharmaceuticals. The interfaces encountered in pharmaceutical development are addressed first. Then, the fundamental intermolecular forces are presented, along with the thermodynamics of interfacial phenomena. The macroscopic manifestation of these fundamentals in the context of the different interfaces accompanying them with relevant applications from the field of solid dosage forms is then presented. It should be highlighted that the effects of interfacial phenomena should not be examined isolated from the bulk properties of the material and the environmental conditions. The overall properties of the materials have contributions from both bulk and interfacial components. The significance of the contributions from the interfacial component hinges on the surface-to-volume ratio of the system."

abstract = "This paper discusses briefly some of the theoretical problems relating to surface problems as seen by an experimental physicist. In particular, questions are raised concerning the calculation of interaction energies between condensed phases in atomic contact. The main experimental part oof the paper deals with the adhesion between soft elastic solids and shows the importance of combining concepts of surface forces (or surface energies) with the principles of contact mechanics. It is shown that surface roughness can greatly reduce the adhesion between such solids since the higher asperities can prize the surfaces apart and break the adhesions occurring at the lower asperities. If these concepts are applied to very hard, elastic solids very small adhesions may be observed for surface roughtnesses scarcely greater than atomic dimensions even if the surfaces are extremely clean. If, however, the surfaces are ductile the junctions can accommodate the prizing action of the higher asperities and strong adhesions may be observed. The overall conclusion is that adhesion between solids depends not only on surface forces but also on surface roughness and the degree of ductility of the solids themselves."

        abstract = "This work presents an analysis of factors that contribute to the uncertainty on the Hamaker constant A determined by curve fitting theoretical equations to forces measured between macroscopic bodies. The model geometry is a colloidal sphere of radius Rs approaching from a distance z above flat surface plate. The governing equation for non-contact force FNC(z) in a perfect system includes only van der Waals FvdW and Born FBr forces, perfect measurements include other forces FOT,j, and real systems consider experimental noise ΔFm and non-equilibrium forces FNE. The expression for the overall uncertainty budget Δr2A has three groups of factors. The first are relative uncertainties Δr2Xj on each terms Xj in the theoretical force equation. The second are weighting parameters ϕj2 or ωj2 that scale the relative contribution of Δr2Xj. The third are sensitivity factors Sj,k2 as partial derivatives of Xj with regard to xk that scale the contribution of relative measurement uncertainties δr2xk. The general expression Δr2A=∑ωj2∑Sj,k2δr2xk+∑ϕOT,j2Δr2FOT,j+ϕFNE2Δr2FNE+ϕFm2Δr2Fm includes relative contributions from measurement uncertainties δr2Rs,δr2z, measurement noise Δr2Fm, non-equilibrium effects Δr2FNE, and uncertainties in other force terms Δr2FOT,j. Conclusions are that uncertainty in separation distance has a greater contribution to Δr2A than uncertainty in sphere radius, that one point measurements should expect Δr2A≈16Pr2 where Pr is the average relative uncertainty over all measured inputs, and that Δr2A≈2Δr2Fm for multi-point curve-fitting results."

It has been an important field of research and innovation as well as business and technological development for many years, and it will continue to be so in the future. Smart textiles are part of the new technologies that have recently been explored for potential applications in PPE. Three main trends have been identified for product development: users' needs, global systems, and environmental conditions. In addition to wearable electronics that are covered in the next chapter of this book and can act as physiological condition, temperature and humidity sensors, power and data transmitters, and end-of-life indicators, smart materials also provide ways to tackle the new challenges associated with these main development trends. For example, membranes with responsive permeability, including to water vapor, can be produced using shape memory polymers, polymer gels, superabsorbent polymers, grafted polymer brushes, and polymeric ionic liquids. These barrier membranes may even be made self-decontaminating with N-halamines, quaternary ammonium groups, bioengineered enzymes, metals and metal oxides, nanomaterials, and light-activated compounds. Thermal comfort can also be improved with phase change materials that can provide additional heat or coolness as the need arises. Finally, a last example of application of smart materials in PPE concerns shear thickening fluids that solidify and become shock absorbers when impacted at high rate. However, testing methods shall be adjusted to take into account these new materials. This includes the characterization of their specific properties, for instance their trigger threshold value, consumed power, magnitude and quality of the response, durability, and interaction with the user’s body.}

This chapter considers the main types of rheological behaviour. The basic ways of modelling them (essentially in simple shear) and the physical origins of the behaviour of different material types are explained and typical real materials behaving in that way are mentioned. The most important behaviour types (yielding and thixotropy) for cementitious or concrete materials, the importance of flow regime (or ‘physical state’) with regards to the time scale of observation and the flow rate for predicting the behaviour type, the importance of distinguishing the main interaction types within the material for evaluating the physical origin of its behaviour are emphasised. Solids, simple fluids, suspensions, slightly non-Newtonian materials, yield stress fluids, thixotropy and viscoelasticity are reviewed.}

title = "Shear Thickening (Dilatancy) in Concentrated Dispersions",
abstract = "A new criterion is introduced for the onset of shear thickening in a concentrated dispersion. The criterion follows from the assumption that shear thickening occurs when the shear forces overrule the interparticle forces. A force balance at small interparticle distances is used to predict the dependence of this critical shear rate on the volume fraction. It is deduced that the critical shear rate is proportional to the interparticle distance, has a linear dependence on the magnitude of the stabilizing force, an inverse linear dependence on the dispersion medium viscosity, and an inverse linear dependence on the particle radius. The model is confirmed experimentally with viscosity measurements on various electrostatically stabilized dispersions. The validity of the model is also checked with data obtained from the literature. Experiments indicate that polydisperse dispersions exhibit pronounced shear thickening but with a less dramatic increase in viscosity than monodisperse dispersions",

abstract  ="The structure of polymer brushes has been the subject of considerable theoretical and experimental activity. Experimental measurements of the steric forces between grafted brushes and the structure of a single brush at the solid-solution interface are in good agreement with theoretical predictions. However{,} the physical structure brush layers adopt under confinement has remained elusive. Here{,} we report measurements of polymer brush density distributions in good solvent as a function of compression. The extension and interpenetration of the brushes are unambiguously determined using neutron reflectivity and contrast matching techniques. The measurements reveal a significant increase in brush concentration at the grafting surface with compression. This is in contrast to theoretical predictions of uniform density distributions as polymer brushes are compressed. The low interpenetration and brush compaction at the anchor surface provides new insight into why such layers are so effective at reducing friction and wear between surfaces."}

Bacteria are one of the most abundant organisms on Earth, and bacterial membrane vesicles (MVs) were first observed 50years ago. Many bacteria release MVs to the environment that mainly consist of the cell membrane and typically range from 20 to 400nm in size. Bacterial MVs are involved in several biological functions, such as delivery of cargo, virulence and gene transfer. MVs can be isolated from laboratory culture and directly from the environment, indicating their high abundance in and impact on ecosystems. Many colloidal particles in the environment ranging in size from 1nm to 1μm have been reported but not characterized at the molecular level, and MVs remain to be explored. Hence, MVs can be considered terra incognita in environmental colloid research. Although MV biogenesis and biological roles are yet to be fully understood, the accumulation of knowledge has opened new avenues for their applications. Via genetic engineering, the MV yield can be greatly increased, and the components of MVs can be tailored. Recent studies have demonstrated that MVs have promising potential for applications such as drug delivery systems and nanobiocatalysts. For instance, MV vaccines have been extensively studied and have already been approved in Europe. Recent MV studies have evoked great interest in the fields of biology and biotechnology, but fundamental questions, such as their transport in the environment or physicochemical features of MVs, remain to be addressed. In this review, we present the current understanding of bacterial MVs and environmental perspectives and further introduce their applications.}

Understanding and controlling the surface adhesion of pathogenic bacteria is of urgent biomedical importance. However, many aspects of this process remain unclear (for example, microscopic details of the initial adhesion and possible variations between individual cells). Using a new high-throughput method, we identify and follow many single cells within a clonal population of Escherichia coli near a glass surface. We find strong phenotypic heterogeneities: A fraction of the cells remain in the free (planktonic) state, whereas others adhere with an adhesion strength that itself exhibits phenotypic heterogeneity. We explain our observations using a patchy colloid model; cells bind with localized, adhesive patches, and the strength of adhesion is determined by the number of patches: Nonadherers have no patches, weak adherers bind with a single patch only, and strong adherers bind via a single or multiple patches. We discuss possible implications of our results for controlling bacterial adhesion in biomedical and other applications.}}

abstract = {The flow properties of an emulsion are obviously among some of its more important physical attributes in either technical or aesthetic terms. Hence the ability to measure, adjust and, if possible, predict such properties is very important. The linear viscoelastic properties are first discussed, i.e. frequency-dependent storage and loss moduli and the time-dependent creep modulus. Then the non-linear, steady state properties such as shear viscosity and normal stress differences are covered, the latter being measurable with care, but because they are so small, it is concluded that for all practical purposes normal stresses — and thus overt elastic effects like die swell and the Weissenberg effect — are irrelevant for most emulsions. The basic rheology-determining parameters of an emulsion are considered next: continuous phase rheology and the nature of the drops (size distribution, deformability, internal viscosity, concentration and nature of particle—particle interaction). These are best discussed as they change the parameters of the so-called Krieger—Dougherty microstructure/ viscosity equation. In qualitative terms the rheology of emulsions is well understood, i.e. the effects brought about by various formulation and processing variables that result in a change of dispersed phase volume, size distribution and particle—particle interaction as well as particle deformability. What we do not have, however, is a very good quantitative understanding — at least compared with dispersions of solid particles — because of the lack of good model systems ranging from monodispersed to known and controlled degrees of polydispersity, together with an independent change in particle deformability. Until this happens, emulsion rheology will continue to be the study of multifunctional effects with best guesses at effects found. For instance, we shall not be able easily to distinguish between the effects of particle deformation and particle-size-distribution width.}
