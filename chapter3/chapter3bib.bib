abstract = {The accepted image of muscovite mica is that of an inert and atomically smooth surface, easily prepared by cleavage in an ambient atmosphere. Consequently, mica is extensively used a model substrate in many fundamental studies of surface phenomena and as a substrate for AFM imaging of biomolecules. In this review we present evidence from the literature that the above picture is not quite correct. The mica used in experimental work is almost invariably cleaved in laboratory air, where a reaction between the mica surface, atmospheric CO2 and water occurs immediately after cleavage. The evidence suggests very strongly that as a result the mica surface becomes covered by up to one formula unit of K2CO3 per nm2, which is mobile under humid conditions, and crystallises under drier conditions. The properties of mica in air or water vapour cannot be fully understood without reference to the surface K2CO3, and many studies of the structure of adsorbed water on mica surfaces may need to be revisited. With this new insight, however, the air-cleaved mica should provide exciting opportunities to study phenomena such as two-dimensional ion diffusion, electrolyte effects on surface conductivity, and two-dimensional crystal nucleation.}

title = {How flat is an air-cleaved mica surface?},
journal = {Nanotechnology},
abstract = {Muscovite mica is an important mineral that has become a standard substrate, due to its easy cleavage along the {001} planes, revealing a very flat surface that is compatible with many biological materials. Here we study mica surfaces by dynamic atomic force microscopy (AFM) operated in the non-contact mode (NC-AFM) under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions. Surfaces produced by cleaving in UHV cannot be imaged with NC-AFM due to large surface charges; however, cleavage in air yields much less surface charge and allows for NC-AFM imaging. We present highly resolved NC-AFM images of air-cleaved mica surfaces revealing a rough morphology originating from a high density of nanometre-sized particles. Among these particles, we find regularly shaped structures indicating the growth of crystallites on the surface. The contamination layer cannot be removed by degassing in UHV; even prolonged heating at a temperature of 560 K under UHV conditions does not yield an atomically flat surface.}

abstract = {Calcined clays as SCM have the potential of compensating the future decrease of slag and fly ash. The present work dealt with a mica mineral, a common component of raw clays, and its change of properties during calcination. Raw and at four temperature levels calcined mica were investigated on the following properties: Water absorption capacity, specific surface area, particle size distribution, lattice parameters by XRD, heat flow and Al-/Si solubility. The results showed a low ion solubility throughout all samples. Thus, the contribution to the chemical pozzolanic reaction due to calcination was low. However, mica's physical and hygroscopic properties influenced the cement hydration. Contrary to common knowledge, which predicts a decrease in water absorption capacity with a decrease in BET specific surface area, calcined mica behaved in the opposite direction. To conclude, for mica containing raw clays the calcination temperature should be lower in regard to mica's physical-hygroscopic properties, but higher in regard to pozzolanic reactivity of other phyllosilicates. Therefore, a balanced calcination temperature should be applied. These results can be used to assess their suitability as SCM in mortar and concrete.}
