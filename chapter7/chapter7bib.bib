abstract="Atomic force microscopyThis chapter presents an introduction to the concept of the dynamic operational modes of the atomic force microscope (AFM). While the static (or contact-mode) AFM is a widespread technique to obtain nanometer-resolution images on a wide variety of surfaces, true atomic-resolution imaging is routinely observed only in the dynamic mode. We will explain the jump-to-contact phenomenon encountered in static AFM and present the dynamic operational mode as a solution to avoid this effect. The dynamic force microscope is modeled as a harmonic oscillator to gain a basic understanding of the underlying physics in this mode.",
