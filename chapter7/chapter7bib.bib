abstract="Atomic force microscopyThis chapter presents an introduction to the concept of the dynamic operational modes of the atomic force microscope (AFM). While the static (or contact-mode) AFM is a widespread technique to obtain nanometer-resolution images on a wide variety of surfaces, true atomic-resolution imaging is routinely observed only in the dynamic mode. We will explain the jump-to-contact phenomenon encountered in static AFM and present the dynamic operational mode as a solution to avoid this effect. The dynamic force microscope is modeled as a harmonic oscillator to gain a basic understanding of the underlying physics in this mode.",

  abstract = {Silica continues to represent an intriguing topic of fundamental and applied research across various scientific fields, from geology to physics, chemistry, cell biology, and particle toxicology. The pathogenic activity of silica is variable, depending on the physico-chemical features of the particles. In the last 50 years, crystallinity and capacity to generate free radicals have been recognized as relevant features for silica toxicity. The ‘surface’ also plays an important role in silica toxicity, but this term has often been used in a very general way, without defining which properties of the surface are actually driving toxicity. How the chemical features (e.g., silanols and siloxanes) and configuration of the silica surface can trigger toxic responses remains incompletely understood.},
