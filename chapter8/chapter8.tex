\chapter{Bacterial colloids AFM}

\section{Introduction}

In addition to this in liquid force curves were produced from probing bacteria. The possibility of force mapping a bacterial surface was investigated, but ultimately ruled impossible on the current machine. However efforts have been made to procure access to a more suitable AFM (See section 2.1).

\subsection{AFM tip treatment} 

Successful adaption and development of the glass treatment to AFM tips was performed. In particular a tip was treated with DCDMS surface coating. This tip was planned to be used with force mapping to investigate the presence of adhesive patches theorized by the group \cite{Teun1} and other literature \cite{Patchy}.
