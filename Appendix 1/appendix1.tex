%appendix
For each measurement site, a minimum of 100 force curve readings per site was taken, with the raw data saved in a single file. The columns alternate with the raw deflection reading for one curve, followed by the corresponding z-piezo value. For the majority of readings the whole curve is measured throughout the reading, combining the approach and retract curves into one whole column. In the case where the cantilever is held at a certain location for a period of time, a new set of columns is appended, with another one starting after it begins movement again, thus fracturing the data whenever an acceleration/deceleration is applied to the cantilever.
