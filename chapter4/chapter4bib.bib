abstract = "Surface crystallization on a commercial grade borosilicate glass wafer, Borofloat® 33, is effectively prevented against 3h of thermal reflow process at 850°C. Surface plasma treatment with three different reactive gases, CF4, SF6, and Cl2, has been performed prior to the annealing. The effect of plasma treatment on surface ion concentration and nucleation of cristobalite were examined through optical microscope and x-ray photoemission spectroscopy. The dominant cause that suppresses crystallization was verified to be the increase of surface ion concentration of alumina during the plasma treatment. Both CF4 and SF6 treatment of no less than 30s showed significant efficacy in suppressing crystallization by a factor of more than 112. Average surface roughness and the optical transparency were also enhanced by a factor of 15 and 3, respectively, compared to untreated sample."

abstract = "An atomic force microscope (AFM) has been used to quantify directly the adhesive interactions between a silica sphere and a planar silica surface. Electrostatic double-layer interactions have also been quantified through analysis of approach curves. The surfaces of the sphere and planar surface were treated prior to measurements either by ethanol washing or by plasma treatment. Adhesion forces were then measured in 0.01 M NaCl solutions at pH 3 and 8. The adhesion force did not vary greatly with pH for a given cleaning procedure. However, the magnitudes of the adhesion forces were substantially less for the plasma treated surfaces. The adhesion forces did not vary systematically with the loading force. Agreement of the adhesion measurements with theory (DLVO, using a non-retarded Hamaker constant based on the latest interpretation of spectroscopic data for water) was good for the ethanol treated surface at pH 3 — conditions where double layer interactions are negligible. However, the plasma treated surface at pH 3 showed adhesion an order of magnitude lower than calculated. In contrast, adhesion at pH 8 was in both cases greater than theoretical expectations, though the lower adhesion for the plasma treated surface was in quantitative agreement with the increased electrostatic double–layer interactions induced by plasma treatment. The results show that the adhesion of such surfaces is a complex phenomenon and that non-DLVO interactions probably play a substantial overall role."
