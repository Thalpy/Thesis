\chapter{Conclusion}

- Surface roughness has 2 points (the rheological argument and the calculated argument) for futher investigation
- Hydration forces could be futher investigated.

Successful adaption and development of the glass treatment to AFM tips was performed. In particular a tip was treated with DCDMS surface coating. This tip was planned to be used with force mapping to investigate the presence of adhesive patches theorized by the group \cite{Teun1} and other literature \cite{Patchy}.
